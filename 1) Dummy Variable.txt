1) Dummy Variable

A dummy variable is a way to represent categories using 0 and 1.
It tells the model whether a category is present or not.

Example:
Color = [Red, Blue, Green]

Dummy variables:

Is_Red → 1 if Red, else 0

Is_Blue → 1 if Blue, else 0

Is_Green → 1 if Green, else 0

So dummy variables are basically binary columns for categories.

2) Label Encoder

A Label Encoder converts each category into a unique integer.

Example:
Color = [Red, Blue, Green]

After Label Encoding:

Blue → 0

Green → 1

Red → 2

It’s simple and compact — but the model may think “2 > 1 > 0”, which can create a false order when categories don’t have ranking.

Used when:

Categories have natural order (like Low, Medium, High)

Or for target labels in classification

3) One-Hot Encoder

A One-Hot Encoder converts categories into dummy variables automatically.

Example:
Color = [Red, Blue, Green]

One-Hot Encoded:

Red	Blue	Green
1	0	0
0	1	0
0	0	1

No false ranking — perfect for machine learning models.
